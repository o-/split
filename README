split personalities web browsing

--------------------------------


Split opens links in different browsers / profiles based on the url.


You're receiving tons of links per day. Some forcing you to login, like 
calendar invitations. If you store cookies this has privacy implication 
for your whole surf-session. Other links point to flashy news sites 
loading content from 20 different domains, fucking up RequestPolicy and 
NoScript noadd-ons. Additionally the tab-list quickly overflows, and you 
don't find anything no more.

Split is a configurable url-opener tool which deals with those issues.
You can tell it which urls to open in which browser or profile. Thus
you can compartmentalize the different parts of your online existence.


limitations
-----------

* Firefox always opens links in the first opened window, even if an
  other profile is given in the command line. Thus split cannot support
  multiple profiles for firefox. We should file a bug report against 
  firefox... 
* Although you can define new browser, split is currently only tested
  with firefox and chromium.


install (debian like)
---------------------

# install split
sudo install -o root -g root -m 755 split /usr/local/bin

# add it to the browsers
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/x-www-browser x-www-browser /usr/local/bin/split 10

# set it to be the primary choice
sudo update-alternatives --set x-www-browser /usr/local/bin/split

# customize your config, define the profiles you need and add domains for your usecases
cp split.conf ~/.split.conf

# test your rules with
split --test someurl


How to use
----------

* Set your shell, mail client, desktop environment, etc. to open links 
  with x-www-browser, if they don't already.
* For links in firefox: install launchy add-on and place the 
  launchy.xml into your chrome folder (see launchy settings for details).
