split personalities web browsing

--------------------------------


You're receiving tons of links per day! Stuff like calendar invitations,
forcing you to login. Or articles on flashy news sites loading content 
from 20 different domains, fucking up your RequestPolicy. Don't mention
the overflowing tab-list.

Split is a configurable url-opener which deals with those issues.
You can tell it which domains to open in which browser or profile. Thus
you can compartmentalize the different parts of your online existence.


limitations
-----------

* Firefox always opens links in the first opened window, even if an
  other profile is given at the command line. Thus split cannot support
  multiple profiles for firefox. We should file a bug report against 
  firefox... 
* Although you can easily add new browsers, split is currently only 
  tested with firefox and chromium.


install (debian like)
---------------------

# get split
git clone https://github.com/o-/split.git && cd split

# install split
sudo install -o root -g root -m 755 split /usr/local/bin

# add it to the browsers
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/x-www-browser x-www-browser /usr/local/bin/split 10

# set it to be the primary choice
sudo update-alternatives --set x-www-browser /usr/local/bin/split

# customize your config, define the profiles you need and add domains for your usecases
cp split.conf ~/.split.conf
vim ~/.split.conf

# test your rules with
split --test someurl


How to use
----------

* Set your shell, mail client, desktop environment, etc. to open links 
  with x-www-browser, if they don't already.
* For links in firefox: install launchy add-on and place the 
  launchy.xml into your chrome folder (see launchy settings for details).
